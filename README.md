# Verification_of_Synchronous_FIFO
Built design of synchronous FIFO using Verilog HDL and verified using constrained-random testbench built using System Verilog. Built test environment blocks generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard etc. Simulated the DUT and TB using Aldec Riviera Pro simulator and analysed the results. The design of FIFO is thus verified.
